# Uplift #

The files in this repo allow you to create a WordPress theme used on the [CaringBridge Uplift blog](http://blog.caringbridge.org/).

Installation
---
Make sure you have the following installed:
* A relatively new version of ruby (use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

Then run the following:

 1. `$ bundler install`
 2. `$ npm install`
 3. `$ grunt`

This will produce a zip file in main directory called `uplift.[time stamp].zip`, which you can then upload as a new theme in the WordPress admin panel.
